# Covid_Analysis
Preliminary data analysis of covid data. Self learning project
I collected covid data from https://covidtracking.com/.
I also retrieved data from population census website.
I performed basic cleaning, did basic analysis to learn python -pandas, matplotlib.
I played around with psycopg2 also a little.
